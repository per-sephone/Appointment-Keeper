Appointment Book Android App by Nora Luna

This project is an Android appointment book. This app contains multiple appointment books owned by specific owners.
First, search for your name to find your Appointment Book. If your Appointment Book does not already exist, it will be created when you submit your name.

Once inside your Appointment Book you can print all your appointments, add a new appointment, or search for existing appointments by datetime.

Adding a new Appointment:
Make sure you include a description, start and end date time. Ensure the begin date time is before the end date time or you will receive an error message.
You will know your appointment was added successfully if you see a success message on the screen.

Searching for Appointments:
You can search Appointments by their starting time. Please enter two datetimes to find the Appointments that start between the two times.
You will see the Appointments printed between the two times, or an error message if none are found.
